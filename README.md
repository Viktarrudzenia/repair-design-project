In this project, I used many interesting things that I have never done before. Each section of this layout was a new challenge for me. So it was fun, but sometimes it really annoyed me. I didn't give up and now I can show you what I'm done. So...

## Also you can check or see my project with few steps

1. Just ```git clone``` my repository or download ```.zip``` file
2. Open ```index.html``` file wherever you want... enjoy it ðŸ˜ƒ

**My recommendations:**

- For ```.scss``` file use *Visual Studio Code extension*: ```Live Sass Compiler```
- For instant view in browser *Visual Studio Code extension*: ```Live Server```
